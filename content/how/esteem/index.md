Self-esteem is a form of self acceptance and respect and means having confidence in one’s worth or abilities. Self-esteem does not happen ‘naturally,’ meaning it is not something that some people just have while others don’t. Having a healthy and positive relationship with oneself, including self acceptance and self respect, is something that is modeled and learned, and then practiced actively. In therapy, you will have structured support around building a positive and stable relationship with yourself.
