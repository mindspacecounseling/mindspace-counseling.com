Connecting with others is an essential part of a fulfilling life. Our brains are wired to bond with others from birth and consider this a survival mechanism. None of this means that relationships “should” come naturally or “should” be easy. There are many circumstances that can complicate relational dynamics. Therapy can help with understanding your own desires and wounds and giving you tools for effective communication and conflict resolution to help build healthy, satisfying, and lasting relationships.
