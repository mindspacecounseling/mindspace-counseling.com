Anxiety is a normal human experience that manifests mentally and physically. It can look like feeling worried or nervous, overthinking, and imagining the worst. It can also look like trouble focusing, restlessness, jitters, upset stomach, or difficulties with sleep.  Anxiety is a normal reaction to stress, but when it feels non-stop and unbearable, it can be overwhelming to the system. Anxiety disorders are conditions in which you have anxiety that does not go away and can get worse over time. The symptoms can interfere with daily activities and can impair family, social, and school or working life. If your anxiety feels unmanageable, therapy is a perfect place to gain deeper understanding, identify root causes, and implement tools to manage symptoms and improve your quality of life.
