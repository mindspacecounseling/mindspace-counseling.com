Moving, graduating, starting a new job, getting married, having kids, losing a loved oneâ€¦. Life is constantly changing and evolving. Sometimes these transitions can be extremely jarring, even when it is something positive! You may feel lost or disoriented as you work to adjust to your new circumstances, and along with that, your new or altered identity and view of the world. In therapy, we can help you to identify and process all of the emotions and thoughts that come up and support you in adjusting and moving forward.
