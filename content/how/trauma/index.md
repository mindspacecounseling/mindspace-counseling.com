Our body has a natural response to stressful, abusive, and traumatic experiences. After the experience is over, sometimes our system will get stuck on that experience and will continue to experience mental and physical symptoms long after. This can create a tremendous amount of distress, difficulty with functioning, and even health problems. Therapy can help you to re-process and heal in a safe environment.
