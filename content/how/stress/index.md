Stress is experiencing worry or tension about a situation. In today's society, we have so many expectations to balance and can easily become burdened with unbearable amounts of stress, which can eventually lead to burn-out. Stress can have negative impacts on health, mood, productivity, relationships, and quality of life. Therapy can help with identifying the sources of stress and developing realistic and healthy strategies to reduce symptoms and effective ways to process and manage stressors.
